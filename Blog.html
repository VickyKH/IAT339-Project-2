                    Hey, hey, hey! Did you catch us during PRIDE Parade??? We dressed up for the occasion with our unapologetic great taste in fashion. We donned a rainbow outfit made from rejected rainbow packaging. We've always had a thing for the oddballs. Weirdos stick together anyways. We topped it off with our head through a giant donut hole. And of course, no pants. You're only as free as you let yourself be. Otherwise, sometimes through all of the societal restraints, we know it can be tough. So just like the theme of this year's PRIDE Parade, we want everyone to know that we are by your side. We've never been the popular kids so WE GOT THIS. YAYAYA let's celebrate PRIDE like nobody's watching!!! Keep that Dirty Mouth of yours, XOXO.

                    Ryan Seacrest was bombed with a box of Dirty Mouth Donuts during his daytime television show. We're so glad that he was brave enough to try all of our novelty donut flavours. He had enough to share with his co-hosts who also braved the tasting. Without a dought his favorite was the Champagne and Oreo Cake Donut. Damn right for a classy guy like him. Did you miss it?

                    Pucker up cuz it's Pickle Month. Come on in during the month of July to get your hands on this novelty donut. Made with all organic, non-GMO and well soaked pickles, these yeast donuts have little chunks of pickles in the fried dough, finished with a pickle juice glaze with salt and vinegar dust. That's right, July is Pickle Month. All pickle welcome. Love it? Hate it? Let's us know you Dirty Mouth. Check it out <a href="donut_pickle.html">here.</a>

                    Hey fellow Dirty Mouths! We're hosting a masquerade fundraiser for the PRIDE. With the recent tragedy in Orlando, we wanted to let everyone know that you shouldn't shut that Dirty Mouth of yours because of hateful people. We have to keep on being strong and fight on because we know we won't shut our filthy Dirty Mouth in the name of fear. So, join us for a celebration of PRIDE in one of the dirtiest holes ever: The Grand Hall of Rock and Roll in Downtown Vancouver. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Tickets can be purchased for $30 at our shop and it includes a full meal, booze and of course, catering from your favorite Dirty Mouth Donuts. Bring your sexiest outfit for a masquerade like no other. All proceeds will be donated to the Vancouver Pride Society to benefit the LGBTQ2+ community.
                  </p>
